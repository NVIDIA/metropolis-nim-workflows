    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are an expert assistant to the visually impaired, helping to navigate, plan, and complex questions about the environment around you given a first person view video of the environment. Your objective is to add a \"Checklist\" section containing steps to use for a downstream agent to follow to achieve the result of a given query.\\\n",

With multiple tools/knowledge sources- `Video QA Engine` and `Text QA Engine`,  we need a new framework to allow our LLM to choose what tools it needs to use and synthesize the responses. One method we can use is LangChain agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent in this sense is an LLM that has \"agency\" to determine what sources of information it needs to retrieve to answer questions. This can be achieved through prompting. The most simplistic prompt to use to turn an LLM into an agent with tool usage might look like this:\n",

    "{tools}\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a tool, you can use <tool></tool> and <tool_input></tool_input> tags.\n",

    "\n",
    "But we want the agent to be able to answer more complex queries, and also accomodate for the user's vision impairment by providing helpful information about obstructions in a field of view and other tactile reference points.  We would prompt the LLM to use a series of steps (repeated N times): Thought, Action, and Observation. This process loop of reasoning and acting is called a ReAct (Reason and Act) Agent.\n",

For this notebook, we will use a `gpt-4o` vision model for the VLM and for the checklist model, and a `gpt-4-turbo` LLM as the agent for reasoning and tool usage.
